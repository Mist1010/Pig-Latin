# Customizing
Replace the string 'words' with either a single word or any amount of words, you may also implement this into your website or just challenge yourself with it by making other languages. If you want the first letters to be uppercase, change the 'case' variable at the beginning of the script to '1', vice-versa for lowercase (change var to 0).

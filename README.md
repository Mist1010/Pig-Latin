# Customizing
Replace the string 'words' with either a single word or any amount of words, you may also implement this into your website or just challenge yourself with it by making other languages. If you don't want the first letters to be lowercase, change the 'case' variable at the beginning of the script to '0', vice-versa for uppercase (change var to 1).
